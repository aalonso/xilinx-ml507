/**
*
* This function sets the options for the IIC device driver. The options control
* how the device behaves relative to the IIC bus. If an option applies to
* how messages are sent or received on the IIC bus, it must be set prior to
* calling functions which send or receive data.
*
* To set multiple options, the values must be ORed together. To not change
* existing options, read/modify/write with the current options using
* XIic_GetOptions().
*
* <b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
*
* Read/modify/write to enable repeated start:
* <pre>
*   u8 Options;
*   Options = XIic_GetOptions(&Iic);
*   XIic_SetOptions(&Iic, Options | XII_REPEATED_START_OPTION);
* </pre>
*
* Disabling General Call:
* <pre>
*   Options = XIic_GetOptions(&Iic);
*   XIic_SetOptions(&Iic, Options &= ~XII_GENERAL_CALL_OPTION);
* </pre>
*
* @param    InstancePtr is a pointer to the XIic instance to be worked on.
*
* @param    NewOptions are the options to be set.  See xiic.h for a list of
*           the available options.
*
* @return
*
* None.
*
* @note
*
* Sending or receiving messages with repeated start enabled, and then
* disabling repeated start, will not take effect until another master
* transaction is completed. i.e. After using repeated start, the bus will
* continue to be throttled after repeated start is disabled until a master
* transaction occurs allowing the IIC to release the bus.
* <br><br>
* Options enabled will have a 1 in its appropriate bit position.
