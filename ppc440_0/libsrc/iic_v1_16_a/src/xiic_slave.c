* The master signals the message completion differently depending on the repeated
* start options.
*
* When the master is not using repeated start:
*  - Not Adressed As Slave NAAS interrupt signals the master has sent a stop
*    condition and is no longer sending data. This doesn't imply that the master
*    will not send a No Ack. It covers when the master fails to send No
*    Ackowledge before releasing the bus.
*  - Tx Error interrupt signals end of message.
*
* When the master is using repeated start:
*  - the Tx Error interrupt signals the master finished sending the msg.
*  - NAAS interrupt will not signal when message is complete as the
*    master may want to write or read another message with this device.
*
* To prevent throttling, the slave must contine to read discard the data
* when the receive buffer is full. When unexpected bytes are received, No Ack
* must be set and the rx buffer continually read until either NAAS
* or Bus Not Busy BND interrupt signals the master is no longer
* interacting with this slave. At this point the Ack is set to ON allowing
* this device to acknowlefge the an address sent to it for the next
* slave message.
*
* The slave will always receive 1 byte before the bus is throttled causing a
* receive pending interrupt before this routine is executed. After one byte
* the bus will throttle. The depth is set to the proper amount immediatelly
* allowing the master to send more bytes and then to again throttle, but at the
* proper fifo depth. The interrupt is a level. Clearing and enabling will cause
* the Rx interrupt to pend at the correct level.
