* Initializes a specific XIic instance.  The initialization entails:
*
* - Check the device has an entry in the configuration table.
* - Initialize the driver to allow access to the device registers and
*   initialize other subcomponents necessary for the operation of the device.
* - Default options to:
*     - 7-bit slave addressing
*     - Send messages as a slave device
*     - Repeated start off
*     - General call recognition disabled
* - Clear messageing and error statistics
*
* The XIic_Start() function must be called after this function before the device
* is ready to send and receive data on the IIC bus.
*
* Before XIic_Start() is called, the interrupt control must connect the ISR
* routine to the interrupt handler. This is done by the user, and not
* XIic_Start() to allow the user to use an interrupt controller of their choice.
*
* @param    InstancePtr is a pointer to the XIic instance to be worked on.
* @param    DeviceId is the unique id of the device controlled by this XIic
*           instance.  Passing in a device id associates the generic XIic
*           instance to a specific device, as chosen by the caller or
*           application developer.
*
* @return
*
* - XST_SUCCESS when successful
* - XST_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND indicates the given device id isn't found
* - XST_DEVICE_IS_STARTED indicates the device is started (i.e. interrupts
*   enabled and messaging is possible). Must stop before re-initialization
*   is allowed.

* None.
